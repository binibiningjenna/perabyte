# 💸 PeraByte – Console-Based Digital Banking System in C++

Welcome to **PeraByte**, a simple yet feature-rich banking system built with C++ for console use. This project simulates core banking operations such as account creation, secure login, deposits, withdrawals, fund transfers, bill payments, loan services, and account management.

Designed as a learning project, **PeraByte** showcases the integration of real-world logic with structured programming principles.
